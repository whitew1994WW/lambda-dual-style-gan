These files are all about generating examples for use in repos and the website.

I have included these images in the repo as they are not too large. These images include:
- Example images used to generate grids
- Style gride (demonstrating different styles)
- ID grids (demonstrating different IDs)
- Weight grids (demonstrating different weights)

The python files I have added:

generate_grid.py - Hits the endpoint with a particular image to save images for the weight grid
stitch_grid.py - Stitches together images to create a single grid

generate_style_examples.py - Hits the endpoint with a particular image for multiple styles and ids for the style and id grids
stitch_style_grid.py - stitches together images for the style_grids
stitch_weight_grid.py - stitches together images for the weight_grids
